# Frequently asked questions - Azure Key Vault Certificate import

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I import a certificate in Azure Key Vault?

Import certificate â€“ requires a PEM or PFX to be on disk and have a private key. Follow [tutorial to import certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-import-certificate#import-a-certificate-to-key-vault)

### After importing password protected certificate into the key vault and then downloading it, I am not able to see the password associated with the certificate?
 	
The uploaded protected certificate after storage into key vault would not save password associated with it. It is only required once during the import operation.

### How can I resolve 'Bad parameter error'? What are the supported certificate formats for importing in Key vault?

When you are importing the certificate, you need to ensure that the key is included in the file itself. If you have the private key separately in a different format, you would need to combine the key with the certificate. Some certificate authorities provide certificates in different formats, therefore before importing the certificate, make sure that they are either in .pem or .pfx format.
